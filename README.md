# Ultimate tic tac toe
Inspired by [this post](http://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2013/06/16/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/)

This is a super little project, which may support multiplayer later.

## todo
refactor the whole thing using ember. Right now, the app is a big mess with data
and dom elements put together, it's ugly. And it'll be easier to make the app
bigger with ember (multiplayer, sessions and stuff like that).
